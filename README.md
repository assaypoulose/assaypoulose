I'm Assay from India! I'm a Full Stack Developer and I'm passionate about coding with over 2.5 years of experience building robust web applications using React.js and Next.js. I spent most of my time working on Full-Stack projects, particularly in web development. I have a passion for learning programming languages and frameworks, including Java, JavaScript, Express, and Node.js, and I'm particularly interested in exploring AWS Cloud technologies. I'm skilled at solving complex problems and have a deep understanding of software logic and troubleshooting. With a track record of delivering high-quality code and optimizing existing features, I'm eager to contribute to a dynamic team and take on new challenges in a growth-oriented environment.
