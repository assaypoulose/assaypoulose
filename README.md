I'm Assay from India! I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 2.5 years of experience building robust web applications using React.js and Next.js. I have a passion for learning new programming languages and frameworks, including Java, JavaScript, Express, and Node.js, and I'm particularly interested in exploring AWS Cloud technologies. I'm skilled at solving complex problems and have a deep understanding of software logic and troubleshooting. With a track record of delivering high-quality code and optimizing existing features, I'm eager to contribute to a dynamic team and take on new challenges in a growth-oriented environment.
